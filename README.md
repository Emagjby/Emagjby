### GenchoXD

Just a developer focused on building solid systems, clean abstractions, and tools that feel good to use.

I like understanding how things work under the hood, designing architectures from scratch, and learning by building real projects instead of following tutorials.

### What I work on:
- Languages, runtimes, and data formats  
- Backend-heavy systems and infrastructure  
- Tooling, developer experience, and performance  
- Experimental ideas under **Emagjby Labs**

Most finished work lives on my personal GitHub.  
Experiments and research live in Emagjby Labs.
